one of the importtant fundamentals of authentication is not store the plain context password into the database
you should encrypt it to make it very strong aganist brute force attacks 
to make this encryption i will use bcryptjs for this encryption
bycryptjs ----> it is a javascript implementation for encryption
this module is third party module that we can install it into our application  ---> npm i bycryptjs
this module use hash function to hash the password (encrypt it)
hash function takes two parameters :-
1- the string that we want to hash it
2- salt or cost parameter by default 12
this module use sceure hash algorithm (sha256) make salt first means generate the random string even the two same 
password will not be the same after it it will make hash to the salted password sha256(salt+password)
we can use use cost parameter 8 since the 20 years ago but now as the more and more of computer power we can use 12 
salt---> measure how cpu intensive the operation will take and control the time of operation 
the more cost parameter the more and more cpu intensive and more time and more encryption
